# Sunset Vacation Security Policy

This is the security policy for all Sunset Vacation repositories. The
policy explains how vulnerabilities should be reported to the
maintainers of our projects.

## Reporting a vulnerability

The [Sunset Vacation][invite] team prefers responsible vulnerability
disclosure. If you've found a vulnerability, we would like to know so we
can fix it before it is announced publicly.

**Do not open a GitHub issue for a found vulnerability.**

Send details to admins@sunsetcity.bsoyka.me or through a Discord direct
message to an admin of [Sunset Vacation][invite]. You should include:

* a brief description of the vulnerability
* steps to exploit the vulnerability
* optionally the type of vulnerability and any related OWASP category

We will try to reply as soon as possible.

### Exploitation

Please **do not try to exploit vulnerabilities yourself** on any live
projects, especially if doing so could cause interruptions or errors for
others.

Instead, we will look into the issue after receiving your report and
will complete any necessary testing ourselves.

## Bug bounty

We may be willing to offer digital rewards in exchange for responsible
and private vulnerability disclosures, provided the following
requirements are met:

* You must not share any information regarding the vulnerability outside
  of private communication with [Sunset Vacation][invite] admins.
* You must disclose the vulnerability in a timely manner after
  discovering it.
* The vulnerability must clearly affect the operation or usage of one of
  our projects.
* You must be a member of the [Sunset Vacation][invite] Discord server.

We are not required to provide a bounty payment. If you are interested
in a potential reward, please include your Discord user ID in your
message. (If you send details via Discord, this is not necessary.)
